**Facial Emotion Detection Model**

This project is a Facial Emotion Detection System that classifies human emotions into seven categories using a deep learning model trained on the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle.
#📌 Features
•	Detects emotions from real-time webcam feed or images
•	Trained on FER2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) dataset
•	Uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for classification
•	Implemented with Keras, OpenCV, and TensorFlow
  **🗂 Dataset**
•	The model is trained using the FER2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 grayscale images (48x48 pixels) categorized into:
😠 Angry | 🤢 Disgust | 😨 Fear | 😃 Happy | 😐 Neutral | 😢 Sad | 😲 Surprise
Dataset Source: FER2013 on Kaggle
Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

**⚙️ Model Training**
•	CNN model with 4 convolutional layers
•	Batch size: 32
•	Optimizer: Adam
•	Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy
•	Training duration: 50 epochs

#🚀 How to Run
Simply Download Code  and extract ,open in vs code or other IDE.
Install Dependencies
•	pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python matplotlib seaborn
**Run Emotion Detection on Images**
•	Run this file: emotion_detect_from_image.py 
•	As 2-3 sample images were in img folder you can also add to that and check for custom image just change image name with extension in line 14
frame=cv2.imread("img/surp.jpeg") 
**Run Emotion Detection on Webcam**
•	Run this file: real_time_emotion.py
**To Train model and work with your model**
•	Download Dataset from Kaggle FER2013 and then check path 
•	Check that the dataset paths in your code (train_data_dir and validation_data_dir) are correctly set to your local directory.
•	The default settings in this project are:
 batch_size = 32
epochs = 50
•	You can adjust batch size and epochs based on your system’s capacity:
Higher batch size (e.g., 64 or 128) → Faster training but requires more RAM
Lower batch size (e.g., 16) → Slower training but works on low-memory systems
More epochs (e.g., 150+) → Improves accuracy but increases training time
•	Run file in terminal  it may take some time from hours to day after that one file will be saved to folder with extension .h5 
•	Once training is done, you can use the trained model for real-time emotion detection via webcam  and for image also ,just use your model file name in here:
model=load_model('src/model_file_50.h5')
